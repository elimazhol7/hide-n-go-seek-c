1. The program reads the file **line by line** using a while loop.
This allows the program to process files of any size, including very large files, 
without storing all the names in memory. The program does not rely on knowing the total number of
names ahead of time.
2. A while loop is used with the condition getline(file, line). 
This reads each line sequentially until the end of the file (EOF) is reached, 
ensuring that every name is checked exactly once.
3. The program uses a boolean flag (‘found’) initialized to ‘false’. 
If the target name is not found after checking all lines, the program prints a message indicating that 
the name was not found. This ensures the user receives feedback even when the search is unsuccessful.
4. The program assumes one name per line. If multiple names are present on a single line, the 
program treats the entire line as a single name. Therefore, it will not correctly find individual 
names if they share a line. This behavior aligns with the lab specification, which assumes one name per line.
